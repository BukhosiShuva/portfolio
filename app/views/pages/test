                Hi, I’m Bukhosi Shuva — an entry-level Software Developer at Arise Church and a recent ICT graduate from Ara Institute of Canterbury. 
                I’m passionate about creating digital experiences that combine functionality with beauty,
                I believe great software should feel user-friendly, look good, feel good to use, and solve real-world problems with elegance.
                <br> 
                <br>
                At Arise Church, I contribute to real-world development projects that support internal systems and community engagement, while continuing to build my skills in 
                full-stack development, API integration, and UI design. I also gained industry experience through my internship at Seequent, where I helped deliver key features for 
                the Evo platform using Python, React, and MongoDB.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I’m actively seeking a graduate or associate software engineering role where I can expand my skills, grow professionally, and bring value to innovative teams.
                My motto? “Feel the fear and do it anyway.” I believe growth begins outside of your comfort zone, and I’m always ready to take on new challenges with curiosity and courage.
                <br>
                <br>
                I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore opportunities that allow me to make a positive impact through technology.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="italic">Join me on this journey of coding with elegance, where every line of code is a brushstroke
                on the canvas of technology.</span>

CurlSpire was a mock website that I built for my Interactive Media Development class.
This platform was designed to help people with curly hair—specifically textures ranging from 3A to 4D. The purpose of the website is to connect with local hair salons, barbershops, and beauty stores.
CurlSpire was created not only to facilitate meaningful connections within the curly hair community but also to educate, inspire, and empower individuals to embrace and care for their natural curls with confidence.
The site includes features that are still in prodcution like stylist directories, product recommendations, and a blog for sharing curly hair tips, stories, and tutorials. the full deployment of this website will see and have a 
huge impact in the lives of people with curly hair

Emerge is an exciting and significant milestone for Ara’s Bachelor of ICT and Graduate Diploma students, as it marks the successful completion of their
Work-Integrated Capstone Projects. This event serves not only as a celebration but also as a networking opportunity where students can connect with potential employers. I was fortunate
enough to be tasked with developing a website for this event, which would serve as a platform for past and current students to showcase their projects and connect with industry professionals.
The website was developed to ensure that potential employers could still engage with students and their work even after the event, Making it easy to connect with both current and past students for future job opportunities.
The website features a gallery of student projects, allowing visitors to explore the innovative work being done by students in the program, A virtual tour of the the students posters, student profiles with bios. 
Future implementation of this project will envolve adding a blog section where students can share their experiences and insights from the event, as well as a feedback form for employers to provide input on the projects they viewed.
Text replacements, and a content management system to allow student profiles and projects to be updated easily.

In the last semester of my degree at Ara Institute of Canterbury, I had the opportunity to work on a Software engineering Intern at at Seequent. During my internship I was tasked to create a data managemnt feature for the Evo platform, which is a data management 
and visualization tool used by geoscientists. Seequent’s EVO platform is a cloud-based ecosystem used by industries like mining and civil to collaborate and manage geoscience data in a single space. The platform is in limited availability in production and it only has a set group of users. The team at Seequent is working to ensure that geoscientist can effectively manage their data,
by implementing different features that offer proficient data management, data planning, accurate analysis, and reliable results. One of those features includes the EVO Data Stages which was the main focus of this project.  
The purpose of the stages feature was to enable geoscientists to classify, give updates, and give more details about their geoscience objects. The project was divided into 3 phases. For this project. I was to focus on the first 2 phases, however, due to requirement changes that led to time constraints and the project starting late, I could only complete the 1st phase of the feature and not phase 2 which would give Org administrators CRUD abilities to modify existing stages.
The expected outcome for the project was that clients would be able to set a stage for their geoscience object data, for example, approved or work in progress, enabling end-to-end workflow management for the data managers. Now that the project is completed the first phase of the stages feature has been fully implemented, allowing users to set a hardcoded stage to a geoscience object. 
Data management is very important as it allows users to interact with their data. Now that the Evo Data stages feature is completed it has the potential to create a workflow around the different stages, enhancing collaboration, clarity, and communication processes, and providing effective data management. From my knowledge derived from meetings that were had with the architecture and project owner, the feature will be further developed to allow administrators to modify the existing stages to suit their organizations, as well as add triggering actions to the stages.
